This is my project involving infrastructure as code using terraform.
These are the steps i followed to execute this project:

-Installed terraform and docker after creating an ec2 instance and a git repository naming it iac(infrastructure as code)

-wrote a terraform script to create a docker container in the main.tf file 

-after successfully writing the terraform script, i initialised the terraform script using the terraform init command 

-followed by the terraform plan and terraform apply command 

-This lead to the successful creation of a docker container up and running 

-as per the steps mentioned in the pdf i also used terraform destroy command and it destroyed the docker container that was up and running.
